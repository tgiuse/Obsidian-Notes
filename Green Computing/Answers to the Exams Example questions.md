4. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth would be an icy, inhospitable planet. The greenhouse effect raises the Earth's average temperature by about 32 K, creating a stable, life-supporting climate.
5. In blockchains there are a couple of options to validate a transaction, those being: Proof of work and Proof of Stake.
   **Proof of work**
   This is  consensus algorithm used to: validate new transactions, add them to the blockchain and prevent malicious actors from tampering with the chain. In simple words it is a computational puzzle that must be solved before a clock is accepted by the network. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, miners (nodes that do the computation) must: compete to solve a difficult mathematical problem. This problem involves finding a number (called a nonce) that, when combined with the block's data and passed through a cryptographic hash function, results in a hash that meets specific conditions (e.g., starts with a certain number of zeros) → “mining”.
   **Proof of stake**
   Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain systems as an alternative to Proof of Work. Instead of using computational power to validate transactions and create new blocks, PoS uses ownership (stake). Validators are chosen to create new blocks and the chance of being selected depends on the “stake”. Validators are rewarded with transaction fees.

7. Federated Learning (FL) represents a paradigm shift in distributed learning. It's a distributed learning approach where a central server coordinates the collaborative training of a global model across numerous clients.
   This approach can reduce the carbon footprint of computation by minimizing data transfer, particularly from edge devices to centralized servers, and potentially reducing the need for energy-intensive data centers.
