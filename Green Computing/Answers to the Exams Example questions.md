5. In blockchains there are a couple of options to validate a transaction, those being: Proof of work and Proof of Stake.
   **Proof of work**
   This is  consensus algorithm used to: validate new transactions, add them to the blockchain and prevent malicious actors from tampering with the chain. In simple words it is a computational puzzle that must be solved before a clock is accepted by the network. Before a new block can be added to the blockchain, miners (nodes that do the computation) must: compete to solve a difficult mathematical problem. This problem involves finding a number (called a nonce) that, when combined with the block's data and passed through a cryptographic hash function, results in a hash that meets specific conditions (e.g., starts with a certain number of zeros) → “mining”.
   **Proof of stake**
   Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain systems as an alternative to Proof of Work. Instead of using computational power to validate transactions and create new blocks, PoS uses ownership (stake). Validators are chosen to create new blocks and the chance of being selected depends on the “stake”. Validators are rewarded with transaction fees.
